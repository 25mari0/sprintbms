- Follow through with learning React and modern frontend development.
- Implement a payment system for subscriptions (Stripe).

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js & Express
- TypeScript
- TypeORM & PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin

### Frontend
- React, Hook Form & React Router
- Vite dev server
- TypeScript

### Key Aspects
- DRY principles
- Fully Dockerized backend (frontend not Dockerized by choice)
- Async-wrapped error handling
- Refresh & access cookies with IP location fingerprinting
- Optimized DB operation frequency to improve performance
- Husky (git hooks) with Prettier & ESLint
- .env used (to be replaced by a Vault later)
- Tools: pgAdmin, TablePlus, Postman

## Progress

- Stripe payments are integrated on the backend and frontend
- Backend is around 70% done, just needs a few more optimizations and a couple more routes
- Frontend is starting to take shapeâ€”most pages have a proper flow; now adding functionality and uniform styling
