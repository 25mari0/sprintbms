## Self "Educational" Goals

- Learn and develop following true business/collaborative project structures.
- Use proper software development procedures: structural organization, pipelines, modularity, security, testing, separation between dev and prod environments, etc.
- Follow through with learning React and modern frontend development.
- Implement a payment system for subscriptions (Stripe).

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js & Express
- TypeScript
- TypeORM, PostgreSQL & Redis
- pgAdmin

### Frontend
- React, Hook Form, React Router & Zustand
- Vite dev server
- TypeScript

### Key Aspects
- DRY principles
- Fully Dockerized backend (frontend not Dockerized by choice)
- Async-wrapped error handling
- Refresh & access cookies with IP location fingerprinting
- Redis caching following both Cache-Aside & Cach-Only patterns
- Husky (git hooks) with Prettier & ESLint
- .env used (to be replaced by a Vault later)
- Tools: pgAdmin, TablePlus, Postman

---

## Progress
- Stripe payments are integrated on the backend and frontend
- Backend is around 70% done, just needs a few more optimizations and a couple more routes
- Frontend is starting to take shapeâ€”most pages have a proper flow; now adding functionality and uniform styling
